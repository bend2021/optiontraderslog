    <h2>Terms of Use</h2>

    <p></p>

    <p>
        Option Traders log (&#8220;the app&#8221;, &#8220;app&#8221;, &#8220;this app&#8221;) is not by any means a guarantee of profitability or not. All calculations are estimates intended for educational use only. All of the information provided in this app is provided as an 
        <strong>estimate only</strong>
            and 
        <strong>does not claim</strong>
            to be an accurate prediction of current, past, or future/theoretical values. Furthermore, Option Traders log 
        <strong>does not and will not claim</strong>
            that estimated profits/loss on strategies and/or estimated prices/option chain data will be accurate. By using the app, you consent to this policy.
    </p>

    <p>I (the developer of this app) am not a licensed financial advisor or SEC registered professional and do not give any financial advice or recommendations directly or through the medium of this app. I do not try to encourage you to make any one trade over another, if any trade at all, either directly or through the medium of this app.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>All trades made are your decision solely.</strong>
            I (the developer of this app) disclaim all liability to any user of this app or not. I am not liable for any doing or misdoing resulting from information from this app or not. I am not liable for inaccurate information resulting from this app or not. Use of this app is your choice, and your choice solely. By using the app, you consent to these terms.
    </p>

    <h4>Options Finder Tool</h4>

    <p>
        The goal of this tool is to act as an educational scanner to determine which options may/may not be profitable given user-entered parameters (expected move in price of underlying, minimum number of days until expiration, and initial outlay). The results displayed by this tool 
        <strong>are not trade suggestions </strong>
        and do not claim in any way to be an accurate analysis of any options chain. 
        <strong>Furthermore, no profit potential is guaranteed, promised, insinuated, or implied.</strong>
            The options finder tool is subject to the same terms and conditions as stated above. All and any liability is reiterated as disclaimed. No data by the options finder tool or any other function of the app is proclaimed to be accurate nor should it be taken as such under any circumstances.
    </p>

    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>Option Traders log is just that&#8230; a calculator. The app doesn&#8217;t need much info about you to work, and the info it does need is public, non-confidential, and not supplied by the user. With that being said, the app does not sell your strategy ideas (or store them anywhere but locally on your device and iCloud for syncing). </p>

    <h4>Analytics</h4>

    <p>Analytics collected by the app does not include any of your strategy data. Using Google&#8217;s Firebase, the app sends conversion data (how many users use a certain feature, upgrade, etc.) and related metrics provided by Google&#8217;s SDK.</p>

    <h4>Crash Reports &amp; Diagnostics</h4>

    <p>
        When you submit a crash/error report or keep the automatically generated diagnostics report in a support/feedback email from the app, the report may include strategy/leg data saved on your device
        <strong></strong>
        as the app locally prints this data to make debugging crashes easier and reproducible. 
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">That is the only use of the data.</span>
        <strong>You&#8217;re under no obligation to keep the diagnostics file attached or send these prompted, non-automatic crash reports</strong>
        , but if you choose to do so, you acknowledge that it was 
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your choice</span>
            to do so. When the app crashes for any reason, I use Google&#8217;s Firebase to try and reproduce the crash on my end so I can get it fixed. Automatic logs potentially containing information about your saved strategies are only sent under these circumstances and are only used for this reason.
